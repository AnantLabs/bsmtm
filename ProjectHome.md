The Data Transformer enable you perform advanced data transformations involving multiple inputs and outputs schemas. It uses the annotation capabilities of XSD (XML Schema Definition) to define output schemas helping to create advanced structure and data validation capabilities.

The Data Transformer API provides a way to create xsl transformers, based in a mapping model and the XSD standard.Default implementations are available either for the mapping model using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or for XSL generation.

Combined with other BeeSphere Open source converters;Excel, Flat or X12, HL7 and Edifact converters; the Data Transformer allows you to translate data from any supported source document type to any supported target document type. Supported Data formats includes:

  * Excel
  * Flat Files Delimiter and Fixed Length
  * XML (Extensible Markup Language)
  * JASON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  * EDIFACT (United Nations/Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport)
  * X12 (Electronic Data Interchange standards for the United States)
  * HL7 (Health Level 7)

The Data Transformer is extendable to any degree of complexity using customized XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) enabled transformation functions.

Using Data Transformer with other BeeSphere converters, you can get the integration capabilities needed to on-board global partners into e-commerce eliminating barriers raised by differences in semantics and data schemas.
